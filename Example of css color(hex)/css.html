    <h1>GENERAL PROGRAMMING RULES</h1>
    <p>
        <pre class="p1"><big>
 Programming rules are an attempt summarize the programming experience 
 of programmers, and the theoretical considerations raised by computer
 scientists. Some programming rules apply to all programming language, 
 they stem from general principles like:</big>

                A) Modern computers are very powerful, memory became relatively
                cheap, and modern compilers automatically optimize code better
                than the average programmer.
                So, saving memory or CPU time is no longer of prime importance:
                what is important is creating programs that are easy to VALIDATE 
                (check that the results are correct) and MAINTAIN (change to suit 
                different future needs).

            <big>
                B) The building units of program code, procedures and functions, 
                should be made as GENERAL (suitable for many similar applications) 
                and FLEXIBLE (able to handle different types of input and computing 
                requirements) as possible. 
                This principle promotes CODE REUSABILITY (using parts of old programs 
                in new ones), and also helps improve coding since programs that don't 
                rely on special assumptions tend to be more reliable.

                c) Programs should have a well organized internal structure.
                The MODULARITY PROGRAMMING PARADIGM requires partitioning every program 
                into relatively small units, each performing a well defined.
