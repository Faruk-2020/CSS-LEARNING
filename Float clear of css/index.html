    <p class="demo1 clearfix">The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate
        to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty,
        and we must rise with the occasion.
        As our case is new, so we must think anew and act anew.- Lincoln
    </p>
         <p class="clear">Let not him who is houseless pull down the house of another,
        but let him work diligently and build one for himself,
        thus by example assuring that his own shall
        be safe from violence when built.
        Discourage litigation. Persuade your neighbors
        to compromise whenever you can. As a peacemaker
        the lawyer has superior opportunity of being a 
        good man. There will still be business enough.
    </p>
      <p class="demo2">Fourscore and seven years ago our
        fathers brought forth on this continent,
        a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and
        dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.- Lincoln
