You can use these selectors when you need to select an element 
that is the descendant of another element, for example, if yo
want to target only those anchors that are contained within an
unordered list, rather than targeting all anchor elements.
Inorder to create a descendant selector, the two selectors
must be seperated by a space, ancestor first and followed by descendants
