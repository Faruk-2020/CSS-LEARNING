    <h3>Everything you could possibly want to know about<br> CSS
         Background Properties: Interpreting the <br>w3c specifications with 
         browser support and<br> links to examples and test cases.
    </h3>
    <p>
        There are 8 attributes controlling background images. The CSS3<br> background
        properties are very well supported in modern browsers,<br> but a few values are
        not. Also, there are some properties and values<br>that have not yet made it
        into the specifications, but are already<br> supported in all browsers except 
        Firefox.. This blog post goes <br>over all the existing and future attributes,
        targeting them with the<br> DOM, and lets you know of bugs you may find when
        implementing backgrounds.
